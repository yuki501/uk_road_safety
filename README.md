The UK government collects and publishes (usually on an annual basis) detailed information about traffic accidents across the country. This information includes, but is not limited to, geographical locations, weather conditions, type of vehicles, number of casualties and vehicle manoeuvres.

The dataset comprises of two files:
 Accident_Information.csv: every line in the file represents a unique traffic accident (identified by the Accident_Index column), featuring various properties related to the accident as columns.
 Vehicle_Information.csv: every line in the file represents the involvement of a unique vehicle in a unique traffic accident, featuring various vehicle andpassenger properties as columns.
The two above-mentioned files/datasets can be linked through the unique traffic accident identifier (Accident_Index column).
